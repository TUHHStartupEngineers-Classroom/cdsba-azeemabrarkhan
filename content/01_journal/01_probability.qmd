# Assignment-I

```{r}
pS = 0.3              #scope to be changed
pTWhenS = 0.2         #'on time' when scope changes
pTNotWhenS = 0.8      #'not on time' when scope changes

pSNot = 0.7           #scope to not be changed
pTWhenSNot = 0.6      #'on time' when scope does not change
pTNotWhenSNot = 0.4   #'not on time' when scope does not change
```

```{r}
pTAndS = pS * pTWhenS                 #'change in scope' and 'on time'
print(pTAndS)
```

```{r}
pTAndSNot = pSNot * pTWhenSNot         #'no change in scope' and 'on time'
print(pTAndSNot)
```

```{r}
pTNotAndS = pS * pTNotWhenS            #'change in scope' and 'not on time'
print(pTNotAndS)
```

```{r}
pTNotAndSNot = pSNot * pTNotWhenSNot   #'no change in scope' and 'not on time'
print(pTNotAndSNot)
```

```{r}
totalProbability = pTAndS + pTAndSNot + pTNotAndS + pTNotAndSNot
print(totalProbability)
```

# Assignment-II

```{r}
#percentages according to devices used
onlySmartphone <- 42.3
onlyTablet <- 27.8
onlyComputer <- 10.0
smartphoneAndTablet <- 7.3
tabletAndComputer <- 3.3
computerAndSmartphone <- 8.8
allThreeDevices <- 0.5
```

```{r}
#What is the percentage of customers using all three devices?
allThreeDevices
```

```{r}
#What is the percentage of customers using at least two devices?
atleastTwoDevices <- smartphoneAndTablet + tabletAndComputer + computerAndSmartphone + allThreeDevices
print(atleastTwoDevices)
```

```{r}
#What is the percentage of customers using only one device?
onlyOneDevice <- onlySmartphone + onlyTablet + onlyComputer
print(onlyOneDevice)

```

# Assignment-III

```{r}
# A: Faulty product and A': Flawless product
# B: Alarm triggered and B': No Alarm
# P(B|A): Probability of alarm when the product is faulty
# P(B'|A'): Probability of no alarm when the product is flawless
# P(B|A'): Probability of alarm when the product is flawless
# P(A'|B): Probability of flawless product when the alarm is triggered
# P(A|B): Probability of faulty product when the alarm is triggered

alarmWhenFaulty <- 0.97 #P(B|A)
noAlarmWhenFlawless <- 0.99 #P(B'|A')
alarmWhenFlawless <- 1 - noAlarmWhenFlawless #P(B|A')
faulty <- 0.04 #P(A)
flawless <- 1 - faulty #P(A')
```

```{r}
# P(A'|B)
flawlessProductWhenAlarm <- (alarmWhenFlawless * flawless)/(alarmWhenFlawless * flawless + alarmWhenFaulty * faulty)
print(flawlessProductWhenAlarm)
```

```{r}
# P(A|B)
faultyProductWhenAlarm <- (alarmWhenFaulty * faulty)/(alarmWhenFlawless * flawless + alarmWhenFaulty * faulty)
print(faultyProductWhenAlarm)
```

These results show that in case the alarm is triggered, there is a possibility of about **19.83%** that the product is flawless and a probability of **80.16%** that the product is faulty.
